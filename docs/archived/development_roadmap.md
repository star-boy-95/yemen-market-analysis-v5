   - Complete the `CointegrationTester` class in `src/models/cointegration.py`
   - Implement Johansen procedure for multivariate analysis
   - Add half-life calculation functions

2. **Threshold Models Enhancement** (High Priority)
   - Complete the M-TAR implementation in `src/models/threshold.py`
   - Add support for exogenous conflict variables
   - Implement asymmetric adjustment tests

3. **Spatial Econometrics Implementation** (High Priority)
   - Complete the `SpatialEconometrics` class in `src/models/spatial.py`

   - Create market accessibility functions

4. **Documentation Completion** (Medium Priority)
   - Finish API documentation for all modules
   - Create usage examples for key functions
   - Update implementation status in implementation_plan.md

## Resource Allocation

### Critical Path Components

These components should receive the most development resources:

1. **Cointegration Module**: Foundation for all market integration analysis
2. **Threshold Models**: Core of the nonlinear price adjustment analysis
3. **Policy Simulation**: Critical for policy recommendations

### Bottleneck Identification

Potential bottlenecks to anticipate:

1. **Large Dataset Performance**: Especially for spatial analysis with many markets
2. **Model Reestimation**: Can be computationally expensive in simulations
3. **Visualization Rendering**: For complex maps with many markets and connections

### Performance Optimization Focus

Key areas for optimization:

1. **Spatial Weight Matrix Calculations**: Use sparse matrices
2. **Threshold Grid Search**: Implement parallelized search
3. **Simulation Parameter Sweeps**: Use parallel processing

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Econometric Validation

- [ ] Validate against established econometric software (R, STATA)
- [ ] Compare results with published papers on threshold cointegration
- [ ] Verify spatial econometric results against GeoDa or similar tools

### Code Quality Metrics

- [ ] Maintain >90% test coverage for core modules
- [ ] Ensure full type annotation compliance
- [ ] Follow NumPy docstring convention consistently

### Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Keep API documentation synchronized with implementation
- [ ] Update implementation_plan.md as components are completed
- [ ] Create tutorial notebooks for main analysis workflows

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Complex Model Convergence**: Implementation may require adaptive algorithms
   - *Mitigation*: Implement multiple estimation approaches with fallbacks

2. **Memory Issues with Large Spatial Datasets**:
   - *Mitigation*: Use chunked processing and sparse representations

3. **Visualization Performance**:
   - *Mitigation*: Implement progressive rendering and data aggregation

### Project Risks

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - *Mitigation*: Clearly document dependencies between modules

2. **Feature Creep**:
   - *Mitigation*: Prioritize core econometric functionality over advanced features

3. **Performance vs. Accuracy Tradeoffs**:
   - *Mitigation*: Implement both fast and accurate versions of critical algorithms

## Development Best Practices

1. **Implementation Sequence**:
   - Start with core functionality before visualization
   - Implement models in order of dependency
   - Write tests alongside implementation
   - Document parameter interpretations and diagnostic checks

2. **Code Structure**:
   - Follow PEP 8 standards with NumPy docstrings
   - Use snake_case for functions and variables
   - Use CamelCase for classes
   - Prefix private functions with underscore

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Use the `handle_errors` decorator consistently
   - Implement validation with clear error messages
   - Provide fallback options when possible

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Vectorize operations where possible
   - Use memory-efficient data structures
   - Implement parallel processing for intensive operations
   - Apply M1/M2 optimizations when available

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a comprehensive guide for completing the Yemen Market Integration project. By following the prioritized implementation sequence, focusing on core econometric models first, and maintaining robust testing and documentation practices, the project can be successfully implemented with high quality and performance.

The modular architecture allows for incremental development and testing, with clear dependencies between components. This approach supports both the research objectives of understanding market integration in conflict-affected Yemen and the practical goal of providing policy simulation tools for humanitarian and development interventions.
