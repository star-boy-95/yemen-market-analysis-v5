# Yemen Market Integration Project: Overview

## Project Purpose

This project implements advanced econometric methodologies for analyzing market integration in conflict-affected Yemen. It provides a computational framework to:

1. Quantify how conflict-induced transaction costs impede market arbitrage
2. Analyze the impact of dual exchange rate regimes on price transmission
3. Simulate policy interventions to enhance market integration
4. Visualize spatial and temporal patterns of market fragmentation

The analysis employs threshold cointegration and spatial econometric techniques to measure barriers to market integration, offering policy insights for humanitarian and development interventions.

## Research Context

Yemen's protracted conflict has fragmented its commodity markets, creating a dual economy with:

- Divergent exchange rates between regions (north vs. south)
- Disrupted trade routes due to conflict barriers
- High transaction costs that impede normal price arbitrage
- Persistent price differentials across politically separated territories

This fragmentation impedes the flow of essential commodities, exacerbates food insecurity, and undermines economic recovery. Understanding the extent of market disintegration and identifying potential policy interventions is crucial for humanitarian and development programming.

## Econometric Framework

The project implements a multi-faceted econometric framework built around these core components:

### 1. Time Series Analysis

- **Unit Root Testing**: Determines the stationarity properties of price series, including tests that account for structural breaks due to conflict events
- **Cointegration Analysis**: Tests for long-run equilibrium relationships between prices across markets
- **Threshold Cointegration**: Models nonlinear price adjustment due to transaction costs as thresholds that must be exceeded before arbitrage occurs

### 2. Spatial Econometrics

- **Spatial Weight Matrices**: Quantifies market connectivity adjusted for conflict barriers
- **Spatial Lag Models**: Analyzes geographic dependencies in price formation
- **Market Accessibility Indices**: Measures how conflict affects market access

### 3. Policy Simulation

- **Exchange Rate Unification**: Simulates the impact of harmonizing dual exchange rates
- **Connectivity Improvement**: Models the effect of reduced conflict barriers on market integration
- **Welfare Analysis**: Quantifies benefits of policy interventions through price convergence metrics

## Technical Architecture

The project is organized into modular components following a logical dependency chain:
