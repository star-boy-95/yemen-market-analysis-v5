   - *Mitigation*: Implement progressive rendering and data aggregation

### Project Risks

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - *Mitigation*: Clearly document dependencies between modules

3. **Performance vs. Accuracy Tradeoffs**:
   - *Mitigation*: Implement both fast and accurate versions of critical algorithms

## Development Best Practices

1. **Implementation Sequence**:
   - Start with core functionality before visualization
   - Implement models in order of dependency
   - Write tests alongside implementation
   - Document parameter interpretations and diagnostic checks

2. **Code Structure**:
   - Follow PEP 8 standards with NumPy docstrings
   - Use snake_case for functions and variables
   - Use CamelCase for classes
   - Prefix private functions with underscore

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Use the `handle_errors` decorator consistently
   - Implement validation with clear error messages
   - Provide fallback options when possible

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Vectorize operations where possible
   - Use memory-efficient data structures
   - Implement parallel processing for intensive operations
   - Apply M1/M2 optimizations when available
