#### Derived Conflict Metrics

| Variable | Type | Description | Units | Calculation |
|----------|------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| conflict_intensity | Float | Weighted conflict intensity | Index (0-5) | Weighted sum of events by type and fatalities |
| conflict_intensity_normalized | Float | Normalized conflict intensity | 0-1 scale | Min-max scaling of conflict_intensity |
| conflict_buffer | Float | Spatial extent of conflict impact | km | Buffer around conflict events (10km default) |
| conflict_duration | Integer | Length of sustained conflict | Days | Consecutive days with conflict events |

#### Processing Notes

- Events are geo-coded and mapped to the nearest market
- Intensity is calculated using a weighted scheme: battles (weight=1.0), violence against civilians (weight=0.8), explosions (weight=1.2)
- For spatial analysis, conflict events create buffers that can intersect market catchment areas

## Exchange Rate Data

### Central Bank and Market Exchange Rates

**Source**: Central Bank of Yemen (Aden), Sana'a monetary authorities, and market surveys  
**Frequency**: Weekly  
**Time Period**: 2016-2023  
**Geographic Coverage**: Yemen nationwide, differentiated by control zones  

#### Variables

| Variable | Type | Description | Units | Example Values |
|----------|------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| date | Date | Date of exchange rate observation | YYYY-MM-DD | 2022-06-01 |
| official_rate_north | Float | Official exchange rate in north | YER/USD | 600.00 |
| official_rate_south | Float | Official exchange rate in south | YER/USD | 1200.00 |
| parallel_rate_north | Float | Parallel market rate in north | YER/USD | 610.00 |
| parallel_rate_south | Float | Parallel market rate in south | YER/USD | 1225.00 |
| rate_differential | Float | Difference between north and south rates | YER/USD | 600.00 |
| rate_differential_pct | Float | Percentage difference in rates | Percent | 100.00 |

#### Processing Notes

- Exchange rates are smoothed using a 7-day moving average to reduce volatility
- When official rates are unavailable, parallel market rates are used
- Rate differential is calculated as absolute and percentage differences
