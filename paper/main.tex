\title{Market Unity Amidst Conflict: Key Econometric Methodologies for Yemen's Market Integration}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Yemen's protracted conflict has severely fragmented its commodity markets, creating a dual economy with divergent exchange rates and disrupted trade routes. This paper analyzes market integration dynamics in conflict-affected Yemen, employing threshold cointegration and spatial econometric techniques to quantify price transmission barriers. By modeling how conflict-induced transaction costs impede arbitrage and examining the impact of dual exchange rate regimes, we identify critical thresholds that must be exceeded before price convergence occurs. Through simulations of market integration scenarios, particularly exchange rate unification, we provide empirically grounded policy insights to enhance economic stability in this fragile and conflict-affected situation. The research bridges theoretical gaps in understanding market integration under conflict conditions while offering practical recommendations for humanitarian and development interventions.
