# Yemen Market Analysis Enhancement Plan

## Project Overview

This implementation plan outlines the approach for merging `run_yemen_analysis.py` and `run_full_analysis.py` scripts while enhancing the econometric reporting capabilities to meet both academic publication standards and World Bank requirements. The goal is to create a unified analysis framework with comprehensive model comparison and publication-quality visualizations.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Scripts

1. **run_yemen_market_analysis.py**: Main entry point for market analysis with basic reporting
2. **run_full_analysis.py**: Comprehensive analysis with more detailed reporting
3. **src/run_integrated_analysis.py**: Core analysis functions for threshold models
4. **src/visualization/enhanced_econometric_reporting.py**: Current reporting module

### Current Limitations

1. Fragmented analysis workflows across multiple scripts
2. Reporting not fully aligned with academic econometric standards
3. Limited model comparison capabilities
4. Visualizations not optimized for publication
5. Inconsistent reporting formats across different model types

```

#### 2.1 Implement Academic Econometric Standards

- Formal hypothesis testing with p-values and significance indicators (*, **, ***)
- Confidence intervals for all parameter estimates (95% and 99%)
- Robust diagnostic tests:
  - Heteroskedasticity (White test, Breusch-Pagan)
  - Serial correlation (Breusch-Godfrey, Durbin-Watson)
  - Normality (Jarque-Bera)
  - Specification tests (Ramsey RESET)
- Standardized reporting formats following academic journal guidelines

#### 2.2 World Bank Reporting Enhancements

- Publication-quality tables with LaTeX export capability
- Comprehensive model comparison tables with statistical significance indicators
- Cross-commodity comparative analysis with standardized metrics
- Detailed interpretation of econometric results with policy implications
- Executive summary generation for non-technical audiences

### 3. Comprehensive Model Comparison Framework

```

#### 3.1 Enhanced Model Selection

- Implement comprehensive model selection based on multiple criteria:
  - Information criteria (AIC, BIC, HQC)
  - Likelihood ratio tests
  - Out-of-sample forecasting performance
  - Residual diagnostics
- Compare adjustment speeds across different threshold specifications
- Analyze threshold parameters and their economic significance
- Evaluate model diagnostics and goodness-of-fit measures

#### 3.2 Cross-Model Comparison

- Standardized comparison of different threshold model specifications
- Statistical tests for model selection (likelihood ratio tests)
- Comparative analysis of asymmetric adjustment processes
- Evaluation of model performance across different commodities
- Formal hypothesis testing for parameter differences across models
