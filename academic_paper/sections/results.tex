\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Preliminary Data Analysis}

This section presents descriptive statistics characterizing Yemen's fragmented market environment. Our analysis of commodity price data reveals substantial price differentials across political control boundaries that persist over time, contradicting the Law of One Price. Figure 1 presents price dispersion metrics for key staples (wheat, rice, sugar) across sampled markets, with dispersion metrics calculated as coefficients of variation across markets within each month.

Exchange rate data confirms the emergence and persistence of a dual currency regime. Figure 2 tracks the divergence between exchange rates in Houthi-controlled versus government-controlled territories, demonstrating that the gap widened dramatically following the Central Bank's relocation to Aden in 2016 and has persisted despite periodic convergence attempts.

Spatial visualization of price differentials reveals clear segmentation along political control boundaries, with substantially larger price gaps between markets separated by conflict lines compared to those within the same governance zone, even when geographic distance is controlled for.

\subsection{Threshold Cointegration Results}

Our threshold cointegration analysis yields several key findings regarding the nonlinear dynamics of price transmission in Yemen's fragmented markets.

Table 1 presents the estimated threshold parameters ($\gamma$) for wheat, rice, and sugar markets across different market pairs. These parameters, interpreted as the minimal price differential required to trigger arbitrage, range from 15\% to 28\% across commoditiesâ€”substantially higher than pre-conflict levels and typical transportation costs.

The threshold effects are statistically significant based on Hansen and Seo's sup-LM test, confirming that price adjustment in Yemen follows a nonlinear process consistent with high conflict-induced transaction costs. Furthermore, the threshold parameters correlate significantly with conflict intensity measures along key trade routes, supporting our hypothesis that security-related costs contribute to market fragmentation.

Adjustment speeds also vary significantly between regimes. Table 2 presents the error-correction coefficients for both the lower and upper regimes. Within the threshold band (lower regime), adjustment speeds are effectively zero, indicating that small price differentials persist without correction. In contrast, beyond the threshold (upper regime), adjustment speeds are significantly higher but still substantially lower than those observed in more integrated markets, reflecting the dampening effect of conflict-related barriers on arbitrage efficiency.

The M-TAR model results confirm significant asymmetry in adjustment processes. As shown in Table 3, positive deviations (price increases) are corrected more rapidly than negative deviations (price decreases), consistent with patterns observed in other conflict zones where supply disruptions can rapidly drive prices upward while constraints on trade flows impede downward price adjustments.

Importantly, adjustment speeds and threshold parameters exhibit substantial variation across political boundaries. For market pairs separated by front lines, the threshold parameters are on average 40\% higher, and adjustment speeds are 63\% lower compared to market pairs within the same governance zone. This finding quantifies the economic impact of political fragmentation on market integration.

\subsection{Spatial Analysis of Market Integration}

Spatial econometric analysis provides further evidence of market fragmentation along political lines. Moran's I statistics indicate significant spatial autocorrelation in commodity prices, but this spatial dependency is primarily confined within governance zones rather than across the entire country.

Table 4 presents the estimated spatial autoregressive parameters ($\rho$) for wheat markets under various specifications of the spatial weight matrix. The baseline specification, which uses inverse distance weights without adjusting for conflict barriers, yields a high spatial autoregressive parameter (0.76), suggesting strong price dependencies. However, when the weight matrix is modified to account for conflict intensity along transport routes, the parameter decreases substantially (0.42), indicating that conflict-related barriers significantly disrupt spatial price transmission.

Figure 3 maps the local spatial autocorrelation statistics (local Moran's I) for wheat prices, revealing distinct spatial clusters within governance zones and spatial outliers along frontline areas. This pattern is consistent with a fragmented market structure where price signals transmit effectively within political boundaries but face significant barriers when crossing conflict lines.

Notably, the dual exchange rate differential emerges as a significant predictor of spatial price disparities in our models. When controlling for traditional determinants of price gaps (distance, transport costs), the exchange rate differential explains an additional 37\% of the variance in spatial price patterns, underscoring the importance of monetary fragmentation in driving market disintegration.

\subsection{Policy Simulation Findings}

Our policy simulations provide quantitative insights into the potential impact of market integration interventions, with exchange rate unification emerging as a particularly promising approach.

Table 5 presents the simulated changes in threshold parameters under exchange rate unification. By eliminating the exchange rate differential, the average threshold parameter across market pairs decreases by 42\%, suggesting that arbitrage would become viable at substantially smaller price differentials. This finding indicates that the dual exchange rate regime represents a significant structural barrier to market integration, independent of physical trade constraints.

Figure 4 illustrates how exchange rate unification would narrow the "band of inaction" in wheat markets between Sana'a and Aden, reducing the price differential range within which no arbitrage occurs. This narrowing would substantially increase the frequency with which arbitrage forces correct price disparities, leading to more consistent price signals across Yemen's fragmented territories.

Adjustment speeds also improve significantly under the exchange rate unification scenario. As shown in Table 6, the error-correction coefficients in the upper regime increase by an average of 57\% following unification, indicating more rapid price convergence once arbitrage becomes viable. This faster adjustment reflects the elimination of currency conversion costs and exchange rate risk premiums that currently impede cross-regional trade.

The spatial connectivity simulation provides complementary insights regarding the potential impact of improving physical market access. By reducing effective distances between markets to reflect improved security conditions and reopening of key trade corridors, the spatial autoregressive parameter increases from 0.42 to 0.67, indicating substantially stronger spatial market integration. However, this improvement is less pronounced than that achieved through exchange rate unification when implemented alone.

When both interventions are simulated simultaneously, their effects appear synergistic rather than merely additive. The combined simulation yields a 68\% reduction in threshold parameters and a 92\% increase in adjustment speeds, suggesting that monetary and physical market integration measures may be most effective when implemented in tandem.
