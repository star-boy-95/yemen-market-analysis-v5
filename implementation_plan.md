# Implementation Plan for Full Econometric Process

## Overview

This document outlines the necessary changes to update the main script (`src/main.py`) to run the full econometric process with complete specifications. The current script contains several placeholders and simplified implementations that need to be replaced with actual functionality.

## 1. Spatial Analysis Updates

### Current Status
- We've already updated the `calculate_impacts` method to use the newly implemented functionality
- The spatial model implementation is now complete

### Required Changes
- No additional changes needed for this section

## 2. Simulation Analysis Updates

### Current Status
- Uses manually created scenarios instead of actual simulation methods
- The baseline, conflict reduction, exchange rate unification, and combined policies scenarios are all manually created

### Required Changes

#### 2.1 Update Simulation Model Initialization
```python
# Initialize simulation model with proper parameters
logger.info("Initializing market integration simulation model")
simulation_model = MarketIntegrationSimulation(
    data=commodity_data,
    threshold_model=analysis_results.get('threshold_model'),
    spatial_model=analysis_results.get('spatial_model')
)
```

#### 2.2 Replace Manual Baseline with Actual Method
```python
# Calculate baseline scenario using actual method
logger.info("Calculating baseline scenario")
baseline = simulation_model.calculate_baseline()
```

#### 2.3 Replace Manual Conflict Reduction with Actual Method
```python
# Run conflict reduction simulation using actual method
logger.info(f"Simulating conflict reduction with factor: {reduction_factor}")
conflict_reduction = simulation_model.simulate_improved_connectivity(
    reduction_factor=reduction_factor
)
```

#### 2.4 Replace Manual Exchange Rate Unification with Actual Method
```python
# Run exchange rate unification simulation using actual method
logger.info(f"Simulating exchange rate unification with method: {unification_method}")
exchange_unification = simulation_model.simulate_exchange_rate_unification(
    method=unification_method
)
```

#### 2.5 Replace Manual Combined Policies with Actual Method
```python
# Run combined policy simulation using actual method
logger.info("Simulating combined policies (conflict reduction + exchange rate unification)")
combined_policies = simulation_model.simulate_combined_policy(
    reduction_factor=reduction_factor,
    exchange_rate_method=unification_method
)
```

#### 2.6 Update Welfare Effects Calculation
```python
# Calculate comprehensive welfare effects using actual method
logger.info(f"Calculating welfare effects with level: {welfare_metrics}")
welfare_effects = simulation_model.calculate_welfare_effects(
    scenario='combined_policy',
    level=welfare_metrics
)
```

## 3. Welfare Metrics Calculation Updates

### Current Status
- Uses simplified calculations and hypothetical values
- Gini coefficients, bottom quintile impact, and food security improvement are hardcoded

### Required Changes
- Replace the entire `calculate_extended_welfare_metrics` function with actual implementation that uses real data
- Ensure the function calculates metrics based on the simulation results rather than using hardcoded values
- Implement proper distributional analysis using actual income/consumption data if available

## 4. Sensitivity Analysis Updates

### Current Status
- Uses manually created results instead of running actual simulations
- The baseline scenario and sensitivity results are manually created

### Required Changes

#### 4.1 Update Sensitivity Analysis to Use Actual Simulation Runs
```python
# Run sensitivity analysis using actual simulation runs
logger.info("Running sensitivity analysis")
sensitivity_results = {}

# Sensitivity analysis for conflict reduction factor
logger.info("Analyzing sensitivity to conflict reduction factor")
reduction_sensitivity = {}
for factor in reduction_factors:
    logger.info(f"  Testing reduction factor: {factor}")
    result = simulation_model.simulate_combined_policy(
        reduction_factor=factor,
        exchange_rate_method=unification_method
    )
    welfare = simulation_model.calculate_welfare_effects(scenario='combined_policy')
    reduction_sensitivity[factor] = welfare

sensitivity_results['reduction_factor'] = reduction_sensitivity

# Sensitivity analysis for unification method
logger.info("Analyzing sensitivity to exchange rate unification method")
unification_sensitivity = {}
for method in unification_methods:
    logger.info(f"  Testing unification method: {method}")
    result = simulation_model.simulate_combined_policy(
        reduction_factor=reduction_factor,
        exchange_rate_method=method
    )
    welfare = simulation_model.calculate_welfare_effects(scenario='combined_policy')
    unification_sensitivity[method] = welfare

sensitivity_results['unification_method'] = unification_sensitivity
```

#### 4.2 Update Elasticity Calculations to Use Actual Results
```python
# Calculate elasticities using actual simulation results
elasticities = simulation_model.calculate_elasticities(
    baseline_factor=0.5,
    reduction_sensitivity=reduction_sensitivity
)
sensitivity_results['elasticities'] = elasticities
```

## 5. Additional Improvements

### 5.1 Error Handling and Validation
- Add more robust error handling throughout the script
- Validate inputs and outputs at each stage of the process
- Provide informative error messages when components fail

### 5.2 Performance Optimization
- Add progress reporting for long-running operations
- Implement caching for expensive calculations
- Use parallel processing where appropriate

### 5.3 Reporting Enhancements
- Improve the format and content of output reports
- Add summary statistics and key findings
- Include confidence intervals and statistical significance

## Implementation Sequence

1. Update the Simulation Analysis section first, as it's the foundation for the other changes
2. Update the Welfare Metrics Calculation next, as it depends on the simulation results
3. Update the Sensitivity Analysis section last, as it depends on both the simulation and welfare calculations
4. Add the additional improvements throughout the implementation process

## Testing Strategy

1. Test each component individually with small datasets
2. Test the full pipeline with realistic datasets
3. Compare results with expected values or previous implementations
4. Validate results against economic theory and empirical evidence

## Conclusion

Implementing these changes will transform the main script from using placeholders and simplified implementations to using the full econometric process with complete specifications. This will provide more accurate and reliable results for the Yemen Market Integration project.
