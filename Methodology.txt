Market Unity Amidst Conflict: Key Econometric Methodologies for Yemen’s Market Integration

Law of One Price and Spatial Market Integration

A cornerstone of market integration analysis is the Law of One Price (LOP), which posits that in well-integrated markets (absent frictions) identical goods should trade at the same price (after accounting for exchange rates and transport costs). In practice, especially in conflict settings like Yemen, spatially separated markets may deviate from LOP due to impediments such as high transport costs, security risks, or policy barriers. Nonetheless, the LOP underpins arbitrage behavior – traders will move goods from low-price to high-price regions until price differentials narrow ￼. Early empirical work on market integration examined simple price correlations and linear regressions across regions. Over time, however, researchers recognized the need to account for spatial price dynamics – how shocks in one market propagate to others – using time-series techniques. This led to cointegration analyses of regional prices, testing whether a long-run equilibrium relationship (implied by LOP) holds. In Yemen’s context, evidence of cointegration would indicate that, despite conflict, prices in different governorates share a common trend (markets move together). Any persistent violations of LOP would signal market fragmentation, prompting investigation into causes (e.g. blocked roads or currency distortions). Thus, LOP provides a theoretical benchmark for market unity, and spatial price dynamics measure how closely Yemen’s local markets adhere to that benchmark amidst conflict.

Threshold Models, Transaction Costs, and Nonlinear Price Dynamics

Traditional linear models assume continuous adjustment toward equilibrium in every period, but transaction costs and trade frictions can induce nonlinear price dynamics. Threshold models allow for this by recognizing that arbitrage may not occur until a price gap is large enough to cover transfer costs. In their seminal work, Balke and Fomby (1997) introduced the concept of threshold cointegration, demonstrating that small price differentials within a no-arbitrage band might persist, whereas larger differentials trigger corrective trade flows ￼ ￼. In other words, price series might be cointegrated (tightly linked) only when deviations exceed a critical threshold – below that threshold, markets behave as if segmented. This framework is highly relevant for Yemen, where conflict-related costs (e.g. bribes at checkpoints, risk premiums) create “bands” of inaction in trade. Threshold models capture such spatial market integration nuances by allowing distinct regimes: one where the law of one price holds (outside the band) and one where it does not (inside the band). As a result, adjustment toward equilibrium is asymmetric – swift beyond the threshold and negligible within it – reflecting the discontinuous nature of real-world arbitrage under high frictions ￼.

To implement threshold analysis, researchers often employ threshold autoregressive (TAR) or threshold error-correction models. These models split the error-correction term or price differential into regimes defined by a threshold value. When applied to Yemen’s market data, a threshold model can reveal, for example, that grain price disparities between Sana’a and Aden are only corrected once they grow sufficiently large (implying a minimum transport or transaction cost). Below that threshold, prices may drift apart without inducing trade, indicating a temporary breakdown of market law due to conflict constraints. Such nonlinear modeling of price transmission is crucial to understanding “market unity” in Yemen’s war economy.

Threshold Cointegration Techniques (Hansen & Seo, Balke & Fomby, Enders & Siklos)

Building on early contributions, econometricians have developed formal tests and estimation methods for threshold cointegration. Balke and Fomby (1997) provided the initial framework for threshold cointegration as noted above. Later, Enders and Siklos (2001) extended this approach by introducing tests for asymmetric adjustment in the error-correction mechanism ￼. Their two-regime TAR/M-TAR model allows the speed or direction of price adjustment to differ depending on whether, for instance, one market’s price is above or below the other’s (capturing phenomena like quicker convergence when one region’s price is higher than its partner vs. when it is lower). This is particularly pertinent in Yemen’s context: for example, if southern markets respond differently when northern prices rise (perhaps due to supply routes opening) than when they fall, a momentum threshold model can quantify that asymmetry in the long-run relationship.

A further advancement came from Hansen and Seo (2002), who developed a method to estimate threshold cointegration models with an unknown cointegration vector and threshold. They proposed a maximum-likelihood estimation of a two-regime Vector Error-Correction Model (VECM) and a sup-Lagrange Multiplier test to detect the presence of a threshold effect ￼. In practical terms, their approach helps determine endogenously whether a significant threshold exists in the price relationship and where it lies. Applying such methods to Yemeni price data would allow researchers to formally test if, say, a dual-regime error correction is statistically superior to a linear model – evidence that would confirm the existence of transaction cost-induced nonlinearities in Yemeni markets. Together, the techniques of Balke & Fomby, Enders & Siklos, and Hansen & Seo form a toolkit for capturing nonlinear cointegration: they identify when and how strongly disparate markets reconnect, offering insights into the depth of integration amid Yemen’s conflict-driven market frictions.

Asymmetric Price Transmission and Market Adjustment

A key insight from threshold models is that price adjustments are often asymmetric – the speed or magnitude of adjustment differs by regime or direction. Asymmetric price transmission means, for example, that price increases in one market may be passed through to another market differently than price decreases. Balke and Fomby’s threshold mechanism already implies one form of asymmetry (no adjustment when differences are small, and active adjustment when large). Further asymmetries can occur if upward deviations correct faster than downward ones, or vice versa. Enders and Siklos’s (2001) momentum threshold model explicitly captures such directional asymmetry by allowing positive and negative deviations to have distinct error-correction coefficients. This matters in Yemen’s markets: if a supply shock causes a sudden price spike in one city, traders might respond quickly to ship goods there (reducing the spike), whereas a price drop might not elicit as fast a response (perhaps due to perishability or security concerns). Thus, the path back to equilibrium can differ depending on the shock’s direction.

Recent studies underscore the importance of modeling these asymmetries. For instance, Guney, Goodwin, and Riquelme (2019) argue that standard linear models often miss important nonlinear and asymmetric adjustments in spatial price data ￼. By using more flexible approaches (discussed below), they find evidence that price linkages adjust in complex ways rather than a one-size-fits-all speed. The implication for Yemen is that policies or interventions might need to account for such asymmetry – e.g. price spikes due to road closures may subside quickly once roads reopen, but price declines due to a temporary glut might not fully transmit to remote areas if traders are hesitant to lower prices. In summary, asymmetric price transmission analysis, as highlighted by Balke & Fomby (1997) and expanded by others, provides a nuanced view of market adjustment. It shows whether one side of the market (consumer vs. producer, or one region vs. another) bears more of the adjustment burden, which is critical for understanding welfare and food security in Yemen’s fractured economy.

Dual Exchange Rate Regimes and Arbitrage in Conflict Markets

Market integration in Yemen cannot be fully understood without considering the monetary context. The conflict has effectively split Yemen’s financial system, resulting in dual exchange rate regimes. For much of the war, there has been an official or fixed rate used in certain transactions (especially early in the conflict) and a floating market rate elsewhere, as well as a regional divide between the central bank in Sana’a (under Houthi control) and the one in Aden (government-controlled). This dual-exchange system created arbitrage opportunities and distortions: actors with access to cheap official-rate dollars could convert them at the inflated market rate, reaping large profits ￼. Indeed, during the war a wide gap opened between the official pegged rate and the street value of the Yemeni rial, leading to what one analysis called “large-scale profiteering through currency arbitrage” by banks and traders ￼. Such arbitrage not only siphoned resources (e.g. from humanitarian funds that got converted at unfavorable rates) but also meant that the prices of imported goods could diverge between regions. For example, if traders in Aden could obtain USD at a different rate than traders in Sana’a, the local currency cost of imports (fuel, food) would differ, fragmenting the national market.

These dual rates undermine the law of one price because the effective price of goods can vary purely due to currency conversion disparities rather than real trade costs. However, arbitrage can also foster integration under certain conditions – opportunistic traders might buy goods in the region with a weaker currency (where goods are cheaper in USD terms) to sell in the region with a stronger currency, thus linking the markets. In Yemen, some degree of clandestine trade and currency exchange between the two zones likely enforced a loose arbitrage-based connection, preventing prices from drifting completely apart. Researchers examining Yemen’s market unity must therefore account for the exchange rate regime as a driver of price differentials. Empirically, this can be done by incorporating exchange rate terms into price transmission models or by analyzing parallel market exchange rates themselves with threshold models (to see if there is a persistent premium/discount indicating segmentation). The arbitrage condition across dual exchange rates is analogous to a LOP condition in currency markets: if the gap is too large, it invites corrective flows of currency or goods ￼. Understanding these dynamics is essential, as Yemen’s experience mirrors other conflict economies where multiple exchange rates emerge.

Alternative Approaches: Semiparametric and Spatial Models

While threshold VECMs are powerful, researchers have also explored alternative econometric approaches to capture complex price dynamics. One such approach is the Generalized Additive Vector Autoregression (GAVAR) model proposed by Guney, Goodwin, and Riquelme (2019). This is a semi-parametric extension of traditional VAR/error-correction models that allows for flexible, data-driven relationships rather than imposing discrete regimes. Essentially, it introduces smooth nonlinear functions (additive components) to model how price differentials adjust, rather than a sharp threshold. Guney et al. argue this can accommodate mean shifts or gradual structural changes in price linkages ￼. In their application to U.S. regional markets, they found that price transmission could vary with the magnitude of shocks in a continuous way, rather than simply “on/off” once a threshold is crossed. For Yemeni markets, such a method could be valuable if the adjustment process is more gradual or if there are multiple interacting nonlinear factors (e.g. varying transport costs with season or security level). A generalized additive model might reveal, for instance, that when price gaps are small, the adjustment speed slowly increases as the gap widens (rather than zero until a hard threshold). This provides a more flexible characterization of nonlinearities, complementing threshold models.

Another complementary line of inquiry comes from spatial econometrics (Anselin, 1988). Spatial econometric models explicitly incorporate spatial dependence between regions – for example, a spatial lag model would allow the price in one governorate to directly depend on prices in neighboring governorates. Anselin (1988) formally defined spatial econometrics as dealing with spatial interaction (autocorrelation) and spatial heterogeneity in regression contexts ￼. Using these techniques, one can model Yemen’s market integration in a cross-sectional or panel data framework: e.g. examining a snapshot of prices across many markets and accounting for their geographic or network connectivity. If markets that are geographically closer (or connected by trade routes) show stronger price co-movement, spatial models can capture that structure. This is especially useful if conflict disruption is localized – for instance, markets within a well-connected enclave might remain integrated with each other but not with distant markets. Spatial error or spatial autoregressive models can quantify such patterns of integration and spillovers across space. They serve as an alternative to time-series cointegration by focusing on contemporaneous linkages and the role of distance or adjacency in price formation. In summary, semiparametric VAR models and spatial econometric models offer additional lenses to examine market unity in Yemen, going beyond the linear versus threshold cointegration dichotomy to allow more nuanced or geography-aware analyses.

Model Diagnostic Tests and Robustness

Applying advanced models requires careful diagnostic testing to ensure validity. One important step is testing for nonlinearity and threshold effects before and during model estimation. A widely used diagnostic is the Tsay (1989) test for threshold nonlinearity, which uses an arranged regression to detect whether a time series exhibits significant regime-switching behavior ￼. In practice, one might apply Tsay’s test to the price differential between two Yemeni markets to see if a threshold model is warranted (i.e. if a linear AR or ECM is inadequate). If the test rejects linearity, it justifies using TAR or TVECM methods. Additionally, tests like the sup-LM test from Hansen & Seo (2002) can formally compare a linear VECM against a threshold VECM ￼. These statistical checks guard against overfitting nonlinear models when a simpler model would suffice, or conversely, they confirm the presence of structural break-like behavior in price relations.

Another crucial diagnostic element is verifying the stationarity and order of integration of price series. Standard cointegration analysis requires that individual price series are nonstationary (unit root) but a certain combination is stationary. The Augmented Dickey–Fuller Generalized Least Squares (ADF-GLS) test is often employed for unit root testing with greater power than the conventional ADF test. The ADF-GLS (developed by Elliott, Rothenberg, and Stock) locally de-trends the series and has been shown to outperform traditional unit root tests in small samples ￼ ￼. In the Yemen market context, where data may be limited or structural breaks (due to conflict events) are present, using a robust stationarity test like ADF-GLS is important to avoid false conclusions about integration. If prices are found to be stationary on their own, for example, one might instead model them with other techniques (e.g. VAR in levels) rather than cointegration. Furthermore, structural break tests (Chow tests, Quandt-Andrews tests for unknown breaks, etc.) and checks for parameter stability can be applied, given the volatile period of conflict. In sum, a rigorous diagnostic toolkit – including Tsay’s nonlinearity test, unit root tests (ADF-GLS, Phillips–Perron, etc.), and cointegration rank tests – ensures that the chosen econometric methodology is appropriate and that the results for Yemen’s market integration are robust and reliable.

Policy Interventions and Exchange Rate Unification

Finally, the literature and Yemen’s experience highlight how policy interventions can alter market integration. A prime example is exchange rate unification. Multiple exchange rate systems, as seen in Yemen, tend to create price distortions and rent-seeking opportunities, hindering efficient market integration. Unifying the exchange rate – essentially closing the gap between official and market rates – can enhance integration by removing artificial price differentials. In Yemen, the Central Bank’s decision in 2017 to float the rial (moving from a dual-rate to a unified market-determined rate) provides an illustrative case. This policy move was noted to be helpful in reducing currency arbitrage opportunities that had previously diverted resources ￼. By narrowing the exchange rate disparity, the cost of imported goods became more consistent nationwide, thereby aligning prices more closely across regions. In theory, a unified rate means that regardless of whether traders source dollars in Aden or Sana’a, they face a similar cost, so goods can flow without one area having an undue advantage. Empirical studies (e.g. on other countries) have found that eliminating dual exchange rates often leads to more coherent price signals and lowers the wedge that traders exploit for arbitrage, fostering market unity.

Beyond exchange rates, other policy factors in Yemen – such as lifting internal checkpoints, harmonizing tariffs, or coordinating central bank policies – also play a role in market integration. For instance, efforts to reunify monetary policy or allow freer movement of goods would reduce transaction costs and thereby shrink the “thresholds” observed in price behavior. The comments on “Market Unity Amidst Conflict” underscore that Yemen’s markets, while resilient, remain sensitive to policy-driven frictions. Thus, econometric analyses often consider policy changes as potential breakpoints or regime switches. When the exchange rate was unified (even partially), one would expect to see stronger price co-movement between Yemen’s governorates. Conversely, when divergent monetary policies arose (e.g. the introduction of new currency by different authorities, entrenching a dual-rate system ￼), one would expect greater segmentation. By incorporating such policy shifts into the analytical timeline, researchers ensure that the interpretation of integration (or lack thereof) is grounded in real-world changes. In summary, exchange rate unification stands out as a pivotal policy tool to enhance market integration in Yemen’s conflict economy, and its impact is both predicted by theory and observed in practice through more unified pricing and reduced arbitrage.
